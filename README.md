# SacraReg

**SacraReg** is an open-source church management system, forked from [ChurchInfo](https://github.com/ChurchInfo/ChurchInfo), reimagined to focus on **sacramental recordkeeping** alongside traditional church membership management.

This system is designed for churches that wish to track the liturgical and sacramental life of their congregations with care, clarity, and theological integrity.

## ‚úùÔ∏è Purpose

SacraReg goes beyond membership and contributions. It is being actively developed to support:

- A **sacramental registry**, including:
  - Baptism
  - Confirmation
  - First Communion
  - Confession
  - Marriage
  - Holy Orders
  - Anointing of the Sick
- Clergy and celebrant tracking
- Godparent and sponsor relationships
- Liturgical roles and ministry participation
- Parochial records and canonical forms
- Flexible data models for Anglican, Catholic, Orthodox, and other sacramental traditions

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Status

This is an **in-progress fork**. All development is currently live on the `main` branch and tested in a non-production environment.

- Interface updates and schema changes are underway
- Legacy ChurchInfo components are being evaluated and refactored
