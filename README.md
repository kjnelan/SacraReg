# Current Project

ChurchInfo (http://www.churchdb.org/) is a free church database program to help churches track members, families, groups, pledges and payments. 

The ChurchInfo project is managed at Sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/churchinfo/ but I try to sync this repo with every release.. 

# New Project

A new project has been forked from the stable church info project is now called Church Web CRM with the goal of bringing new featuers and creating a responsive application.
