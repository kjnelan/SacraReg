**SacraReg** is an open-source church management system reimagined to focus on **sacramental recordkeeping** alongside traditional membership and contribution tracking.

This project is maintained by **Kenn Nelan**, developed under the **Sacred Wandering Project**.

---

## ✝️ Project Vision

SacraReg builds on the legacy of [ChurchInfo](https://github.com/ChurchInfo/ChurchInfo), expanding it to reflect the **liturgical and sacramental life** of the Church, including:

- Full sacramental registry support:
  - Baptism
  - Confirmation
  - Eucharist (First Communion)
  - Reconciliation
  - Marriage
  - Holy Orders
  - Anointing of the Sick
- Clergy and celebrant recordkeeping
- Sponsor and godparent relationships
- Liturgical roles and ministry participation
- Canonical documentation and pastoral care tracking

---

## 🛠️ Status

This is a live development fork. Changes are being deployed and tested directly in a development environment.

Current development focus:
- Refactoring interface for clarity and modern use
- Adding sacramental tables and workflows
- Defining new data relationships (e.g., clergy, godparents)
- Improving UX and navigation

---

## 🧭 Planned Features

- [ ] New schema for sacramental records
- [ ] Modern UI modules for entry/view
- [ ] Parochial reporting and printable canonical forms
- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout
- [ ] Optional modules for multi-site churches or diocesan reporting

---

## 📦 Requirements (in progress)

Typical LAMP stack:

- PHP 7.4+
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache or Nginx
- Local SMTP and cron support for full functionality

Installation instructions and setup scripts will be documented as development stabilizes.
